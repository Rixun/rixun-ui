<h1 align="center">Rixun UI</h1>

Rixun UI is a UI component library we created with the intention of using it across our own personal projects. The purpose of creating this as opposed to using the popular already made UI libraries is they all contain extra functionality we don't need, and we can tailor the component architecture to our desire.

The UI component library is deployed on NPM for anyone to use. We will develop it over time when we need further features or components. Feel free to raise any bugs or improvement suggestions found when using it.
